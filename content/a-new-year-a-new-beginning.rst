A New Year -- a New Beginning

:excerpt: On the transition from Maker to Manager

As we say goodbye to 2012 and welcome 2013, I'd like to reflect on the
opportunities ahead, but first, I want to say a few words about last
year. Last year has been a tremendous blessing for me, as I've seen
personal grownth in both leadership and overall as a person.

On 2012
-------

I've had to step back from my coding duties at `Balanced`_ several
times during the year and it has been kind of hard to grapple with.
I've empirically proven that the trade-off between running a
successful company and a mediocore one is how much effort I have to
put in managing my developing team and setting expectation with my
co-founders versus programming. This might seem like common wisdom to
many, but, to me, having lived through it -- it's actually much harder
in practice.

There's always that lingering fear of not staying up-to-date with the
latest practices in your field as well as recognizing that your
programming contribution to something you've built from scratch starts
to dwindle. It's a terrifying feeling, but, I've started to realize
that most of today's software is just catching up from decades old
computational theory.

What they don't teach is management. Motivating your employees,
showing them that they can execute a grander vision, while fulfilling
their own personal goals is a very difficult thing to do. I don't
think I can recall having a good manager my entire career. In fact,
when I was working at Wachovia Securities, my manager at the time
pulled me aside and told me that:

    Python will be bad for your career.

    -- Old Manager

Now that the tables have turned, I'm relying more on executive coaches,
process literature, and the `unsung heroes`_ that make the magic
happen behind the scenes.

I once asked `Jack Dorsey`_ about managing personal relationships
with such a rigid schedule. His response wasn't anything spectacular
at first:

    You have to make time for what's most important.  It's hard, but
    you have to have the discipline to do this.

    -- Jack Dorsey

However, reflecting subconsciously on this for a bit, I realized that
personal relationships weren't really the topic here. He just meant
that I have to do the hard work, or "shovel the shit" -- as we like to
call it in the startup world. My mentor, `Yishan Wong`_, has told me that
if you read any "how to be successful" book, you'll just realize that
there's maybe a couple of insightful pointers, but 80% of the rest of
the book can be boiled down to: "shoveling the shit."

    90% of life is just showing up

    -- Woody Allen


I'm going to try to apply it to my daily life. After an awesome health
transformation in 2012, I'm in fantastic shape and all I did was show
up and do the hardwork. Slowly, but steadly. I'm now less than 10%
body fat and can eat half-marathons for breakfast.

Onwards to 2013
---------------

Now as to 2013, I want to start applying more rigidness to my
schedule. I felt inspired by Nathan Barry's `public commitment`_ of
writing 1000 words per day. I can only imagine the intense discipline
required to follow through, but, I find that is something I need to
work on as I juggle `making and managing`_. I need to write and
express my thoughts in an articulate manner.

Reflecting on the tough times of 2012, most issues encountered spawned
from weak communication. I can't stress how important communication is
for both your workplace and your personal relationships.

That's the highlight of this year -- I will want to focus more on
communication and communication mediums.

Some achievable goals in the short term are:

* Write 100 -- not 1,000, words a day
* Learn at least 2 new vocabulary words a week

So it's the same way as going to the gym. Just publish consistently
and eventually it'll become second nature. Point taken.

I'm also going to try to focus to share my mistakes - I find that I
can open up more when I talk about getting things wrong, and it's a
personal touch that many writing journals lack.


Writing
^^^^^^^

As a writing medium, I'm a die-hard emacs user and I hated using
`Wordpress`_ for my writing due to its subpar editor. I've migrated my
blog to use `pelican`_ and now use Emacs to write my blog posts. I'll
discuss more of this migration at a later time.


On a Final Note
---------------

To conclude, I want to share my sincere note of thanks to every one of
you who takes time to read what I have to say.

If you have any tips or advice to share, please do.
