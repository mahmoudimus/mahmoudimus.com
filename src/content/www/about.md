Hi! I'm Mahmoud Abdelkader ([pronounced](media/misc/mahmoud-pronunciation.mp3) [mæħˈmuːd æbdəlkeɪdər](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_Egyptian_Arabic)), but, online, I usually go by the nickname _mahmoudimus_.

I am an entrepreneur and a software engineer. I am the co-founder of [VGS](https://vgs.io) (formerly known as [Very Good Security](https://verygoodsecurity.com)) where I served as CEO from 2016 until 2023, before stepping back into an advisory role. Before that, I served as the CTO and co-founder of Balanced Payments, a graduate of [Y-Combinator](http://ycombinator.com)'s Winter of 2011 class, which exited to [Stripe](https://stripe.com) in 2015.

I've dabbled a bit in e-commerce as an early employee at [Milo.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20110228063546/http://milo.com/), which was [acquired](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/02/confirmed-ebay-acquires-milo-for-75-million-investors-make-a-killing/) by [eBay](https://ebay.com) in 2010 to power their [eBay Local](https://web.archive.org/web/20120325155423/ebay.com/local) initiative.

I'm currently experimenting with AI. I am passionate about fintech, payments, reverse engineering, and data security.
